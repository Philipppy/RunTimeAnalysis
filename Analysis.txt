For all tasks, I do not consider the import and opening of the files

Task 0:
Efficiency: O(2)
Explanation: Since the print statements only print constant values and there is no iteration,
only two lines will be executed

Task 1:
Efficiency: O(2(2*3n+1)+4) = O(12n+6)
Explanation:
The lines outside the function check numbers get executed only once, which is represented by the constant
of 5 which is added.
For each entry in the list, inside check_numbers 2 times three lines and one time the return statement get executed,
which means 2*3n+1.
Because there are two lists which get checked (calls, texts), the whole function runs twice. That's why
it's multiplied by 2


Task 2:
Efficiency: O((2*3n+1)+5)
